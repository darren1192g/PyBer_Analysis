## Summary

### Three business recommendation for addressing any disparities among the city types. 

-	First, there are too many drivers in the Urban department. You have more driver than clients, this is leading to lower income for driver in this area. The drivers need to be placed in other areas or reduced drive to up Fare per Ride so that fare per driver would be increased to.

-	Second, the Rural area can add a few drivers but a client to driver ratio is best around 14% this allows both company and driver to maximize profit without flooding the market or drying it out due to low drivers

-	Third, the Suburban market is following an uptick in the Total Fare by City Type chart. With a bit more advertisement, and driver converted over to this area you could expect the number to keep going up with a few declines in between holidays months.
